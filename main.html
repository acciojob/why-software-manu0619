	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I have a deep passion for technology and its ability to solve real-world problems. From a young age, I was fascinated by how software could transform ideas into reality and improve people's lives. This curiosity led me to explore various programming languages and frameworks, allowing me to build projects that not only challenged me but also fueled my desire to learn more.

As a developer, I thrive in environments where I can constantly learn and apply new skills to solve complex problems. I enjoy the creative process of coding, from brainstorming innovative solutions to debugging intricate issues. Every project is a new opportunity to push my boundaries and think outside the box.</p>
